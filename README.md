  - Firstly, users can use the search function to find biobricks according to the score given by BASE and choose one they need.
  - Then users can make their own devices by using construction function. After constructing, users could upload the device to BASE, and improve the device via the compare function. 
  - At last, users may apply the upload function to submit the device to the iGEM Registry and/or BASE database.
