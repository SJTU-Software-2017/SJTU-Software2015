## Introduction

BASE is web-based tool for biobrick evaluation, helping researchers bulid new devices and systems.
  - The BASE web server is designed to provide a ranking to all existing biobricks and help users design their new devices.
  - Firstly, users can use the search function to find biobricks according to the score given by BASE and choose one they need.
  - Then users can make their own devices by using construction function. After constructing, users could upload the device to BASE, and improve the device via the compare function. 
  - At last, users may apply the upload function to submit the device to the iGEM Registry and/or BASE database.

## Requirement

Our web pages is developed by [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and [Amaze UI](http://amazeui.org/?_ver=2.x).

We use [Perl](https://www.perl.org) as back-end and [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com) as the database.
